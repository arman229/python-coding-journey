18.What are Custom GPTs?
"Custom GPTs" refers to specialised versions of the Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (GPT) models that are tailored for specific tasks, industries, or
data types. These custom models are adapted from the base GPT
architecture, which is a type of language model developed by OpenAI.
Custom GPT models are trained or fine-tuned on specific datasets or for
particular applications, allowing them to perform better in those contexts
compared to the general-purpose models.
Here are some examples of what custom GPT models might be used for:
1. Industry-Specific Needs: A custom GPT for legal, medical, or financial
industries could be trained on domain-specific texts to understand and
generate industry-specific language more accurately.
2. Language and Localization: Models can be customised for different
languages or dialects that might not be well-represented in the training data of
the base model.
3. Company-Specific Applications: Organisations might develop a custom
GPT model trained on their own documents and communications to assist
with internal tasks like drafting emails, generating reports, or providing
customer support.
4. Educational Purposes: Educational institutions might develop custom
GPTs trained on educational material to assist in creating teaching materials
or providing tutoring in specific subjects.5. Creative Writing and Entertainment: Custom models could be trained on
specific genres of literature or scripts to assist in creative writing or content
creation.
6. Technical and Scientific Research: A custom GPT model could be
trained on scientific literature to assist researchers in summarising papers,
generating hypotheses, or even drafting new research.
These custom models are created through a process of fine-tuning, where the
base GPT model is further trained (or 'fine-tuned') on a specific dataset. This
process allows the model to become more adept at understanding and
generating text that is relevant to the specific use case. Fine-tuning requires
expertise in machine learning and natural language processing, as well as
access to relevant training data.
19.What are Actions in GPTs?
Actions are a way to connect custom GPTs to external APIs, allowing them to
access data or interact with the real-world. For example, you can use actions
to create a GPT that can book flights, send emails, or order pizza. Actions
are defined using the OpenAPI specification, which is a standard for
describing APIs. You can import an existing OpenAPI specification or create a
new one using the GPT editor.
