    "ways of using artificial intelligence to generate text, images, audio, and video\n",
    "based on some input, but they have different features and applications. Here\n",
    "is a summary of each one:\n",
    "OpenAI Completion API is the most fundamental OpenAI model that\n",
    "provides a simple interface that’s extremely flexible and powerful. You give it a\n",
    "prompt and it returns a text completion, generated according to your\n",
    "instructions. You can think of it as a very advanced autocomplete where the\n",
    "language model processes your text prompt and tries to predict what’s most\n",
    "likely to come next. The Completion API can be used for various tasks such\n",
    "as writing stories, poems, essays, code, lyrics, etc. It also supports different\n",
    "models with different levels of power suitable for different tasks.\n",

    "supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling.\n",
    "Google Gemini Multi-Modal API is a new series of foundational models built\n",
    "and introduced by Google. It is built with a focus on multimodality from the\n",
    "ground up. This makes the Gemini models powerful against different\n",
    "combinations of information types including text, images, audio, and video.\n",
    "Currently, the API supports images and text. Gemini has proven by reaching\n",
    "state-of-the-art performance on the benchmarks and even beating the\n",
    "ChatGPT and the GPT4-Vision models in many of the tests.\n",
    "There are three different Gemini models based on their size, the Gemini Ultra,\n",
    "Gemini Pro, and Gemini Nano in decreasing order of their size.\n",
    "LangChain is a platform that allows you to interact with various language\n",
    "models from different providers such as OpenAI, Google Gemini, Hugging\n",
    "Face Transformers, etc. You can use LangChain to create applications that\n",
    "leverage the power of natural language processing without having to deal with\n",
    "the complexity of APIs or SDKs. LangChain provides a user-friendly interface\n",
    "that lets you choose the model you want to use, customize the parameters\n",
    "you want to apply, and see the results in real-time.8. Why don't we use Flask or Django for API development instead of\n",
    "FastAPI?\n",
    "● FastAPI is a newer and more modern framework than Flask or\n",
    "Django. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use. FastAPI is\n",
    "also more scalable than Flask or Django, making it a better choice for\n",
    "large-scale projects.\n",
    "● FastAPI is also more feature-rich than Flask or Django. It includes\n",
    "several built-in features that make it easy to develop APIs, such as\n",
    "routing, validation, and documentation.\n",
    "● Overall, FastAPI is a better choice for API development than Flask\n",
    "or Django. It is faster, more scalable, and more feature-rich.\n",
    "9. Why do we need to learn Cloud technologies in a Generative AI\n",
    "program?\n",
    "Cloud technologies are essential for developing and deploying generative AI\n",
    "applications because they provide a scalable and reliable platform for hosting\n",
    "and managing complex workloads.\n",

    "deploying them with Docker Compose, Google Cloud Run, Azure\n",
    "Container Apps, and Kubernetes?\n",
    "● Docker Containers are a way to package software into a single unit\n",
    "that can be run on any machine, regardless of its operating system. It\n",
    "is used to create a Dockerfile, which is a text file that describes how to\n",
    "build a Docker image. The image is then used to create a container,\n",
    "which is a running instance of the image. This makes them ideal for\n",
    "deploying applications on a variety of platforms, including cloud-based\n",
    "services.\n",
    "● Docker Compose is a tool provided by Docker that allows you to\n",
    "define and manage multi-container Docker applications locally. It\n",
    "enables you to use a YAML file to configure the services, networks,\n",
    "and volumes needed for your application's setup. With Docker\n",
    "Compose, you can describe the services your application requires,\n",
    "their configurations, dependencies, and how they should interact with\n",
    "each other, all in a single file. This makes it easier to orchestrate\n",
    "complex applications locally composed of multiple interconnected\n",
    "containers.\n",
    "● Google Cloud Run is a serverless computing platform that allows you\n",
    "to run stateless containers that are invocable via HTTP requests. It is\n",
    "fully managed, so you don't need to worry about provisioning or\n",
    "managing servers.\n",
    "● Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform from Microsoft that\n",
    "allows you to maintain less infrastructure and save costs while running\n",
    "containerized applications. Instead of worrying about server\n",
    "configuration, container orchestration, and deployment details,\n",
    "Container Apps provides all the up-to-date server resources required to\n",
