# Numpy arrays 
# Scaler in Numpy
# Vector in Numpy
# Note Arrays in Numpy are more efficient than Python lists are we can apply more operations in Numpy array not in List.
# Time compersion in Numpy and list  (%%time)
# Boolean in Numpy
# inId search iterms
# where intersectId 
# where: is used to compare the value 
# reshape zeros ,ones ,ones_like
