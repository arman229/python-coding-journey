    "2-1": "Simple Message: Assign a message to a variable, and then print that message.",
    "2-2": "Simple Messages: Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new message.",
    "2-3": "Personal Message: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”",

Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().",
    "2-8": "File Extensions: Python has a removesuffix() method that works exactly like removeprefix(). Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called filename. Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without the file extension, like some file browsers do.",
    "2-9": "Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this: print(5+3) Your output should be four lines, with the number 8 appearing once on each line.",
    "2-10": "Favorite Number: Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.",
    "2-11": "Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.",
    "2-12": "Zen of Python: Enter import this into a Python terminal session and skim through the additional principles.",
    "3-1": "Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.",
    "3-2": "Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.",
