    "2-1": "Simple Message: Assign a message to a variable, and then print that message.",
    "2-2": "Simple Messages: Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new message.",
    "2-3": "Personal Message: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”",
    "2-4": "Name Cases: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.",
    "2-5": "Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks: Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”",

Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().",
    "2-8": "File Extensions: Python has a removesuffix() method that works exactly like removeprefix(). Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called filename. Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without the file extension, like some file browsers do.",
